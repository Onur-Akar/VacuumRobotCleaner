## Robot Vacuum Cleaner
A company is developing two new robot vacuum cleaners to navigate a rectangular room. The robots are equipped with sensors that allow them to detect the edges of the room and obstacles within it. The robots' position and orientation are represented by a combination of x and y coordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. The room is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation. An example position might be 0, 0, N, which means the robot is in the bottom left corner of the room and facing North. In order to control the robot, the user sends a simple string of letters. The possible letters are 'L', 'R', and 'M'. 'L' and 'R' make the robot turn 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot. 'M' means move forward one grid point in the current orientation. Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).
